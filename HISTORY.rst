Release History
---------------

Upcoming
++++++++

- CPython 3.5 support.
- Support for cryptography>=1.0 on PyPy 2.6.
- Travis CI testing for CPython 3.5 and PyPy 2.6.0.

1.2.1 (2015-07-22)
++++++++++++++++++

- The SDK now supports setting a password when creating a shared link.

1.2.1 (2015-07-22)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed an ImportError for installs that didn't install the [jwt] extras.

1.2.0 (2015-07-13)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added support for Box Developer Edition. This includes JWT auth (auth as enterprise or as app user),
  and `create_user` functionality.
- Added support for setting shared link expiration dates.
- Added support for setting shared link permissions.
- Added support for 'As-User' requests. See https://box-content.readme.io/#as-user-1
- Improved support for accessing shared items. Items returned from the `client.get_shared_item` method will
  remember the shared link (and the optionally provided shared link password) so methods called on the returned
  items will be properly authorized.

1.1.7 (2015-05-28)
++++++++++++++++++

- Add context_info from failed requests to BoxAPIException instances.

**Bugfixes**

- ``Item.remove_shared_link()`` was trying to return an incorrect (according to its own documentation) value, and was
  also attempting to calculate that value in a way that made an incorrect assumption about the API response. The latter
  problem caused invocations of the method to raise TypeError. The method now handles the response correctly, and
  correctly returns type ``bool``.

1.1.6 (2015-04-17)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added support for the Box accelerator API for premium accounts.

1.1.5 (2015-04-03)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added support for preflight check during file uploads and updates.

1.1.4 (2015-04-01)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added support to the search endpoint for metadata filters.
- Added support to the search endpoint for filtering based on result type and content types.

1.1.3 (2015-03-26)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added support for the /shared_items endpoint. `client.get_shared_item` can be used to get information about
  a shared link. See https://developers.box.com/docs/#shared-items

1.1.2 (2015-03-20)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Certain endpoints (e.g. search, get folder items) no longer raise an exception when the response contains items
  that are neither files nor folders.

1.1.1 (2015-03-11)
++++++++++++++++++

- A minor change to namespacing. The ``OAuth2`` class can now be imported directly from ``boxsdk``.
  Demo code has been updated to reflect the change.

1.1.0 (2015-03-02)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features**

- The SDK now supports Box metadata. See the `metadata docs <https://developers.box.com/metadata-api/>`_ for
  more information.

- The object paging API has been improved. SDK extensions that need fine-grained control over when the next "page"
  of API results will be fetched can now do that.

**Example Code**

- The example code has been improved to be more robust and to work with all Python versions supported by the SDK
  (CPython 2.6-2.7, CPython 3.3-3.4, and PyPy).

- The example code has an example on how to use the new metadata feature.

- The README has improved code examples.

**Bugfixes**

- Oauth2 redirect URIs containing non-ASCII characters are now supported.
