    An iterator that represents a collection of Box objects (BaseObject).

    A BoxObjectCollection instance contains everything it needs in order to retrieve and page through
    responses from Box API endpoints that return collections of Box objects.

    This class only has two public methods:

    1). next(), which returns either a Page (sequence of BaseObjects) or individual BaseObjects based on
    the constructor argument 'return_full_pages'.

    2). next_pointer(), which returns the pointer (either an offset or a marker, based on the endpoint) that
    will be used to retrieve the next page of Box objects. This pointer can be used when requesting new
    BoxObjectCollection instances that start off from a particular page, instead of from the very beginning.
