    """A metaclass for enum hierarchies.

    This allows you to define hierarchies such as this:

        from box.util.compat import with_metaclass

        class EnumBase(with_metaclass(ExtendableEnumMeta, Enum)): pass

        class Enum1(EnumBase):
            A = 'A'

        class Enum2(EnumBase): pass

        class Enum2_1(Enum2):
            B = 'B'

        class Enum2_2(Enum2):
            C = 'C'

    and have all members be accessible on EnumBase (as well as have all members
    of Enum2_1 and Enum2_2 be available on Enum2) as if they had been defined
    there.

    Non-leaf classes still may not have members directly defined on them, as
    with standard enums.

    Most of the usual enum magic methods are extended: __contains__, __dir__,
    __getitem__, __getattr__, __iter__, __len__, and __reversed__. Only __new__
    is not extended; instead, a new method `lookup` is provided. The
    __members__ property is also extended.

        If this is a leaf enum class with defined members, this acts the same
        as __new__().

        But if this is a base class with no defined members of its own, it
        tries doing a value lookup on all its subclasses until it finds the
        value.

        NOTE: Because of the implementation details of Enum, this must be a new
        classmethod, and can't be implemented as __new__() [1].
