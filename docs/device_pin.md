List Enterprise Device Pins
---------------------------

To retrieve all device pins for an enterprise, call
[`client.device_pinners(enterprise=None, limit=None, marker=None, direction=None, fields=None)`][device_pinners].
If an `enterprise` is not specified, this defaults to the current enterprise.  This method returns a
`BoxObjectCollection` that allows you to iterate over the [`DevicePinner`][device_pin_class] objects in the collection.

```python
device_pins = client.device_pinners()
for pin in device_pins:
    print('Pinned {0} device for {1}'.format(pin.product_name, pin.owned_by.name))
```

Get Device Pin Information
--------------------------

To get information about a specific device pin, call [`device_pinner.get(fields=None)`][get].  This method returns a new
[`DevicePinner`][device_pin_class] object with fields populated by data from the API.

```python
device_pin_id = '1111'
device_pin = client.device_pinner(device_pin_id).get()
print('{0} device for {1} is pinned'.format(pin.product_name, pin.owned_by.name))
```

Delete Device Pin
-----------------

To delete a specific device pin, call [`device_pinner.delete()`][delete].  This method returns `True` to indicate that
the deletion was successful.

```python
device_pin_id = '1111'
client.device_pin(device_pin_id).delete()
print('Device pin deleted!')
```
