## Create upload session

Creates an upload session for a new file.

This operation is performed by calling function `create_file_upload_session`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/post-files-upload-sessions/).

<!-- sample post_files_upload_sessions -->

```python
client.chunked_uploads.create_file_upload_session(parent_folder_id, file_size, file_name)
```

### Arguments

- folder_id `str`
  - The ID of the folder to upload the new file to.
- file_size `int`
  - The total number of bytes of the file to be uploaded.
- file_name `str`
  - The name of new file.
- extra_headers `Optional[Dict[str, Optional[str]]]`
  - Extra headers that will be included in the HTTP request.

### Returns

This function returns a value of type `UploadSession`.

_Currently we don't have an example for calling `create_file_upload_session_for_existing_file` in integration tests_

### Arguments

- file_id `str`
  - The unique identifier that represents a file. The ID for any file can be determined by visiting a file in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123` the `file_id` is `123`. Example: "12345"
