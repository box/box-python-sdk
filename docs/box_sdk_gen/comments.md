## List file comments

Retrieves a list of comments for a file.

This operation is performed by calling function `get_file_comments`.

See the endpoint docs at
[API Reference](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-files-id-comments/).

<!-- sample get_files_id_comments -->

```python
client.comments.get_file_comments(file_id)
```

### Arguments

- file_id `str`
  - The unique identifier that represents a file. The ID for any file can be determined by visiting a file in the web application and copying the ID from the URL. For example, for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123` the `file_id` is `123`. Example: "12345"
- fields `Optional[List[str]]`
  - A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the response. This can be used to request fields that are not normally returned in a standard response. Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the effect that none of the standard fields are returned in the response unless explicitly specified, instead only fields for the mini representation are returned, additional to the fields requested.
- limit `Optional[int]`
  - The maximum number of items to return per page.
- offset `Optional[int]`
  - The offset of the item at which to begin the response. Queries with offset parameter value exceeding 10000 will be rejected with a 400 response.
